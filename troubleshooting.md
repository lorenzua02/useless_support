## Client and server don't talk each other
- Try to ping the ip of the other player. If it fails, check the firewall settings
- Teammates have to change the support_ip variable (you have to use soraka's hamachi IP)

## The port has been used already
Change port (the variable "port") on both files

Make sure you are using a port number greater than 1000

## Any python-related problem
- Make sure you have python writing "py" on your command prompt: you can download python <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a>
- Install packages: run "pip install keyboard", "pip install socket", "pip install pynput".

For any problem, open an Issue here on github or write me on Discord (Lollo#9343)
