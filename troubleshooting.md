## Client and server don't talk each other
- Ping soraka's (or teammates') ip using cmd. If it fails, check the firewall settings
- Teammates have to set the `support_ip` variable to the soraka's hamachi IP

## The port has been used already
Change `port` variable on both files. Make sure you are using a port number greater than 1000

## Python-related problems
- Make sure you have python writing `py`, `python` or `python3` on your command prompt: you can download python <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a>
- Install the dependencies running `pip install keyboard socket pynput`

For any problem, open an Issue here on github or write me on Discord (Lollo#9343)
